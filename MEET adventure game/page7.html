        Even though you dont know how you became friends with these people or why you became friends with them
        you do know that your past self made a good choice. After spending a bit more time with them you seamlessly fit into
        the friend group and did not get treated like a stranger. These people became your friends for life and you spent the rest of
        your life with them.
