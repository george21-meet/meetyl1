            Will takes you to meet your friends and he tells them about what happened to your memory.
            they are surprisingly understanding and every one of them tells you fun stories from the past
            and what your previous hobbies were. After they spend more time trying to remind you of who you once were,
            you realize that these efforts are futile. If stories like these cant even give you the slightest hint of familiarity 
            then nothing will. You look at the people around you and think that they are all good people but they remind you of something that is lost.
            Do you want to continue being friends with them despite losing your memory or do you want to leave these links to a missing past behind.
