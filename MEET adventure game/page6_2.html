            Will takes you to meet your friends and everyone starts sharing funny stories and you were in all of them.
            You realize that if stories like these cant even give you the slightest hint of familiarity 
            then nothing will. You look at the people around you and think that they are all good people but they remind you of something that is lost.
            Do you want to tell them about your memory and continue being friends with them or do you want to leave these links to a missing past behind.
