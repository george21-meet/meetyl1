        <p> They were stunned once you said that you dont know them. Lucy dont you remember me Will?
            We were classmates last year and we got along pretty well. He started
            listing a bunch of things that you did together and nothing rung a bell or even felt vaguely familiar.
            Will finished listing and his happy expression started to turn sad when he realized that you truly didnt remember anything.
            Do you trust Will and tell him how you cant remember anything or do you not trust him and make him believe that
            he's so irrelevant that you forgot him.
