        <p> You enter the grocery store and pick out some things to eat.
            You were about to exit the store when you realized that everyone is
            exchanging some form of paper for the products. You step in line
            and when its your turn you look for some of the paper in you wallet but find none.
            A woman behind you offers to pay for you and you desperately accept. The woman says that her name
            is Sophia and that she works as a college recruiter. Sophia says that she thinks that something weird and
            interesting happened to you, so she proposed that if you let her college study whatever happened to you then you
            get a full scholarship. Do you accept her offer or decline it
        </p>
