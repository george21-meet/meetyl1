            You sit at home thinking about what happened  today. You wonder
            if Will and the people that were your friends are trustworthy or even
            if your past self was a good person. You realize that worrying about it is
            useless because you dont know anything about the past so all your thoughts will 
            be based on imagination. You wonder if tommorow you should go and meet them or
            if you should just stay at home.
