            After you introduce yourself the scientists quickly start
            examinating your brain. Sophia also enrolled you into college classes
            because that was part of the deal. You spent the next year attending class
            and having your brain researched untill eventually the scientists gave up because they
            didnt get any results. But because you spent a year in college you regained your social skills
            and made many friends. leading you to have a happy life.
