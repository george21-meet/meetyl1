        <p>
            you spend the day at home and did not go out with your friends.
            Because you forgot how to be social you spent the rest of your life as a loner.
            Despite being a loner, You werent unhappy in life but you werent happy. You found a 
            job as a construction worker where you didnt need to be social this further isolated you from
            society. The life you led was very uneventful
            and boring.
