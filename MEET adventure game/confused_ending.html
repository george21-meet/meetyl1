            Will ran away crying screaming how you're so mean."how could
            you forget me!" he said. After Will ran away you started thinking that
            humans are weird and that you probably should not involve yourself with them.
            For a few days after your encounter with Will, a rectangular thing kept
            shaking and making noises. You decided to throw it away since it was being annoying.
            You landed a job at a grocery store and over time you started to learn about human life.
            You lived life alone avoiding humans and their weird technologies and trends.
