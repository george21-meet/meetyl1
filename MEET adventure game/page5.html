            After Will heard that you dont remember anything a jolt of relief hit him because he realized
            that you didnt forget him because he isnt important but you forgot him because of some bigger problem.
            Will quickly realized that relief isnt the apropriate emotion so he quickly subdued his relieved expression and instead put
            on a worried one. After a bit of silence Will said that what you are experiencing is weird and that you have never had any
            memory issues in the past so this is too sudden. Will proposed the idea of taking you to meet your friends in hopes of them
            jolting your memory and helping you remember everything about your past
