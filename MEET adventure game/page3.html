        <p>while at the apple tree someone calls the name lucy over and over. The idea that it was your name did not pop up in ur mind
            so u didnt respond until they came over and touched you.You turned around confused and saw a young man. Before you could do or say anything  they started babbling.
            You dont know who they are, so what do you do?
